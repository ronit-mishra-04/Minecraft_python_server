---THIS PROGRAM IS STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT--

*This program still has some bugs in it, and I prefer not to download it in your main desktop environment.
*If you want to work in. I'd suggest you put it in a virtual environment (e.g., VMware Workstation, UTM, Virtual Box, etc.)

The main goal of this program is to let you install a Minecraft server on your local system in one click.
Right now, this program can install the dependency of the Minecraft server, which is JDK (Java Development Kit), and can check for which operating system and for which architecture you want the particular JDK.
